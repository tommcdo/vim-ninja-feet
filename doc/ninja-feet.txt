INTRODUCTION                                    *ninja-feet*

ninja-feet.vim provides the means to operator from the cursor to either
the beginning or end of a text object.

The mappings presently only work in |Operator-pending| mode.

MAPPINGS                                        *ninja-feet-mappings*

                                                *o_[* *ninja-left-foot*
{operator}[count][{motion}
                        Perform {operator} from the cursor to the beginning
                        of the text object defined by {motion}. Only text
                        object motions (starting with `i` or `a`) are valid.


                                                *o_]* *ninja-right-foot*
{operator}[count]]{motion}
                        Perform {operator} from the cursor to the end of the
                        text object defined by {motion}. Only text object
                        motions (starting with `i` or `a`) are valid.

                                                *z[* *ninja-insert*
z[{motion}              Enter |Insert| mode at the beginning of {motion}. For
                        |characterwise| motions, this is like pressing `i`;
                        for |linewise| motions, this is like pressing `O`.


                                                *z]* *ninja-append*
z]{motion}              Enter |Insert| mode at the end of {motion}. For
                        |characterwise| motions, this is like pressing `a`;
                        for |linewise| motions, this is like pressing `o`.


EXAMPLES                                        *ninja-feet-examples*

    d]i(                Delete from the cursor to the end of a parenthetical
                        term.

    c[a"                Change from the cursor to the beginning of a quoted
                        string (including the `"` character).

    z[ip                Enter Insert mode on a new line at the beginning of
                        a paragraph.

    z]at                Enter Insert mode after the current closing tag (in
                        XML or HTML).

CUSTOM OPERATORS AND TEXT OBJECTS       *ninja-custom-operators-and-objects*

ninja-feet.vim can also work with custom operators and text objects. Consider
the following example using lion.vim (https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-lion) and
dentures.vim (https://github.com/qstrahl/vim-dentures):

    gl]ii=              Align from the cursor to the end of the indent block by
                        the `=` character.

Caution: Only a true ninja can steal a lion's dentures.

Note if the custom text object does not start with an `i` and/or `a` and you
want to use it with ninja.vim, you have to make it explicitly available.
For example, the custom text object for comments provided by vim-commentary
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) is `gc`. By default `d[gc` does not
work. Add following two lines to your vimrc to define the ninja versions of
`gc` >

    omap [gc <Plug>(ninja-left-foot)gc
    omap ]gc <Plug>(ninja-right-foot)gc

ISSUES AND TODO                                 *ninja-feet-issues*
                                                *ninja-feet-todo*

All operators, including custom operators, support repeating via |.| except for
|c| and |!|. The |z[| and |z]| operators also do not support being repeated.
